# Hover Functionality Fix Summary

## Issue
The hover function was not working when installing from the VSIX module.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was likely caused by missing activation events and insufficient debugging information to identify the problem.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Activation Events (vscode-extension/package.json)
```json
"activationEvents": [
  "onLanguage:mspec"
]
```
**Why**: Ensures the extension activates when MSpec files are opened, which is crucial for the language server to start.

### 2. Enhanced Extension Debugging (vscode-extension/src/extension.ts)
- Added hover middleware to log hover requests and responses
- Added logging for hover requests at specific positions
- Added logging for hover response status

```typescript
provideHover: (document, position, token, next) => {
  outputChannel.appendLine(`Hover requested at ${position.line}:${position.character}`);
  const result = next(document, position, token);
  if (result) {
    outputChannel.appendLine('Hover response received');
  } else {
    outputChannel.appendLine('No hover response');
  }
  return result;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Server Debugging (server/src/server.ts)
- Added detailed logging for hover requests
- Added server initialization logging
- Added hover response logging

```typescript
connection.onHover(async (params: HoverParams): Promise<Hover | null> => {
  connection.console.log(`Hover request received for ${params.textDocument.uri} at ${params.position.line}:${params.position.character}`);
  // ... processing ...
  if (result) {
    connection.console.log(`Hover result: ${JSON.stringify(result.contents)}`);
  } else {
    connection.console.log('No hover result returned');
  }
  return result;
});
```

### 4. Enhanced Hover Provider Debugging (server/src/features/hover.ts)
- Added detailed logging throughout the hover processing pipeline
- Added logging for word detection, symbol finding, and hover type determination

```typescript
console.log(`HoverProvider: Processing hover at ${position.line}:${position.character}`);
console.log(`HoverProvider: Found word "${word}" at position`);
console.log(`HoverProvider: Found keyword "${word}"`);
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Install the Updated VSIX
```bash
cd vscode-extension
npm run build-full
```
Then install `mspec-language-support-1.0.0.vsix` in VSCode.

### 2. Enable Verbose Logging
In VSCode settings:
```json
{
  "mspec.trace.server": "verbose"
}
```

### 3. Test Hover Functionality
1. Open `examples/simple-example.mspec`
2. Verify file is recognized as MSpec
3. Hover over keywords like `type`, `simple`, `uint`
4. Check the MSpec output channel for debug messages

### 4. Expected Debug Output
```
MSpec Language Server started successfully
MSpec Language Server initialized successfully
Hover requested at 5:6
Hover request received for file:///path/to/file.mspec at 5:6
HoverProvider: Processing hover at 5:6
HoverProvider: Found word "type" at position
HoverProvider: Found keyword "type"
Hover result: {"kind":"markdown","value":"**type** *(keyword)*\n\nDefines a structured data type with fields"}
Hover response received
```

## Files Modified
- `vscode-extension/package.json` - Added activation events
- `vscode-extension/src/extension.ts` - Added hover middleware and debugging
- `server/src/server.ts` - Enhanced server-side hover logging
- `server/src/features/hover.ts` - Added detailed hover provider debugging

## Additional Files Created
- `test-hover.md` - Comprehensive testing and troubleshooting guide
- `test-hover-dev.js` - Development testing script

## Next Steps
1. Test the updated VSIX in VSCode
2. Verify hover functionality works on keywords, data types, and symbols
3. Check debug output to confirm proper operation
4. If issues persist, use the troubleshooting guide in `test-hover.md`
